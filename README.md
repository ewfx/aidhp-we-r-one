-   HTML/CSS/JavaScript: For building the frontend and interactivity.

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_name>
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  **Set up Gemini API key:**
    -   Obtain a Gemini API key from Google Cloud.
    -   Place the API key in the .env file
4.  **Prepare data:**
    -   Ensure that `Customer_DB/Customer_Data_with_Social_Media_Activity.csv` and `Product_DB/Wells_Fargo_Products_Full.csv` are in the correct directories or update the `CUSTOMER_DATA_CSV_URL` and `WELLS_FARGO_PRODUCTS_CSV_URL` variables in `app.py` with the correct paths or URLs.
5.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
6.  **Access the application:**
    -   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## Application Structure

-   `app.py`: Contains the Flask application logic, including route definitions, data loading, and AI integration.
-   `index.html`: The main HTML template for the application's user interface.
-   `Customer_DB/Customer_Data_with_Social_Media_Activity.csv`: CSV file containing customer data.
-   `Product_DB/Wells_Fargo_Products_Full.csv`: CSV file containing Wells Fargo product data.
-   `static/`: Directory for static assets (e.g., CSS, JavaScript, images).
-   `templates/`: Directory for HTML templates.

## Important Considerations

-   **API Key Security:** Ensure that your Gemini API key is stored securely, preferably in environment variables, especially in a production environment.
-   **Data Paths:** Double-check the paths to your CSV data files to ensure they are correct.
-   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to gracefully handle potential issues with data loading, API calls, and other operations.
-   **Scalability:** Consider scalability if you anticipate a large number of users.
-   **Security:** Implement appropriate security measures to protect user data and prevent vulnerabilities.

## Disclaimer

This application is a demo and uses sample data. It is not intended for production use with real customer data.
